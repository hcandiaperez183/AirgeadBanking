# AirgeadBanking
An application developed to track investing and compound interest accrual over time.

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

In this project, I was tasked with creating an application that tracks investina and compound interest that is accrued overtime for a company called Airgead Banking. The company wanted me to create an application that would take an initial investment amount and a monthly deposit amount to calculate the compound interest that would be accrued over an amount of time as specified. The company wanted this data to be accessible.

What did you do particularly well?

I think in this project I did well with organizing my code and also utilizing the different files such as cpp, and h files. Also, I think that I maintained industry best practices in my code.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I think that I could enhance my code a bit better by adding in testing to make sure that there are no errors while running it. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

I found it a little difficult getting all of the files to work together in one. Also, I kept getting errors that I was not sure how to fix for a long time. I have been utilizing youtube videos and google to help when I am truly stuck.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

Receiving a task and figuring out how to organize it into code is definitely a useful tool that I will use in the future. In my previous classes, the code we had to create was more structured, and here I was tasked with utilizing my own organization of the code more than I have had before. Also, creating multiple files that work together is an important task that will be transferable in my future projects.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable I applied industry standard best practices. I made sure to add in-line comments and utilized appropriate naming conventions. I also attempted to code in a logical manner.
